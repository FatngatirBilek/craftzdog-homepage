Hi, my name is Fathir. I am an Enthusiast Backend Engineer who enjoys working with technology and learning new things in the IT field. Currently, I'm focusing on learning about several Languages such as **JS**, **PHP**, **Ruby**, and also **C++** to improve my skills and experience as a developer. I am always interested in learning and continuing to develop myself so that I can provide the best and most effective solutions for every project I work on.
