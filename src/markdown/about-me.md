Hi there! Nice of you to take the time to get to know me, it's always a pleasure when worlds collide!

I'm an open book, thanks to my love for reading. I've zoned in on fantasy novels, and I usually finish them in between Windows updates. My favorite authors are currently Brandon Sanderson, Steven Erikson, and [Terry Pratchett](https://xkcd.com/1498/).

I also like to take on fun projects that I can use in my everyday life. Almost everthing I work on is published on my github! Incomplete or in progress repos are set to private, but one day they might see the [light](https://xkcd.com/722/) of day. A recurring theme you'll find is the integration of music in my programs, and if you'd like to preview some of my playlists, check out my [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/omnitenebris)!

Finally, if we follow the pigeon-hole theory, then we'll find that there is no option to be anyone other than yourself, since everyone else is taken. In truth, if you take everything I've said in this about me and place it [in the library of babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/search.html), you'll see how unique my words are!
